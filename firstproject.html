            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <a href = "https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_saga"><img src = "./starwarsepisodesithroughvi.webp" alt="image of the covers to Star Wars Episodes I through VI" /></a>

                <p>Star Wars is amazing. I first experienced Star Wars by watching The Empire Strikes Back when I was 8 or 9 years old. I was immediately enthralled. In the years since, I have become obsessed with Star Wars. I have watched the films. I have watched Star Wars: The Clone Wars. I want to watch Star Wars: Clone Wars. I have read books, guides, and encyclopedias. I am even planning to write a Star Wars Expanded Universe book. In this article, I will tell you about the six live action canon films, the Clone Wars film, the two Clone Wars series, and the Expanded Universe. Let's get started.</p>

            <h2>The Films, the Series, and the Expanded Universe</h2>
                <p>Star Wars is an enormous multimedia franchise. It has multiple films and series. It has many book, stories, and games. It has a set Canon, and an accompanying Expanded Universe.</p>
                    <div id = "thefilms">
                        <h3>The Films</h3>
                            <p>The Star Wars franchise has seven canon films. Six of them are live-action. They are put in numerical order in two trilogies, the Prequel trilogy and the Original trilogy, to form the Star Wars Saga. Three more live-action films were planned as a Sequel trilogy, but, during production, they were cancelled by The Walt Disney Company. There is also an animated spin-off film that goes with and shares its name with an animated series. Their shared name is "Star Wars: The Clone Wars".</p>

                                    <h4>The Star Wars Saga</h4>
                                        <p>The Star Wars Saga is a set of six films organized into two trilogies: the Prequel trilogy, and the Original trilogy. It shows the story of two generations of the Skywalker family. It shows Anakin Skywalker's journey from joining the Jedi Order to falling to the Dark Side of the Force and joining the Sith Order as Darth Vader to his redemption. It shows how Sheev Palpatine --- the Sith Lord Darth Sidious --- took control of the Galactic Republic, formed the Galactic Empire, and was slain by Anakin Skywalker. It also shows Anakin Skywalker's son Luke Skywalker's journey from joining the Jedi Order to bringing his father back to the Light Side of the Force. It shows how the Galactic Republic was replaced with the Galactic Empire, and then how the Galactic Empire was defeated. The saga was planned to have three more films as a sequel trilogy, but, during production, it was cancelled by The Walt Disney Company. It would have shown the story of Anakin Skywalker's grandchildren. It would have shown Leia Organa trying to rebuild the Galactic Republic. It would have shown Luke Skywalker trying to rebuild the Jedi Order. It would have shown Darth Maul controlling the criminal underworld and the remnants of the Galactic Empire. It would have shown Leia Organa becoming Supreme Chancellor of the New Republic. It would have shown Luke Skywalker managing to rebuild much of the Jedi Order.</p>
