            <p>Hi! My name is Jonathan Ketchum. I live in the United States of America. I am learning how to use HTML 5. The pages I make in this website are for the curriculum that is teaching me how to code. You probably would have never guessed this, but I like Star Wars made by George Lucas.</p>
